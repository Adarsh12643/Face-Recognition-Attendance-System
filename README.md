# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
This repository contains the source code for a Face Recognition Attendance System built with Python. The system is designed to automate the process of marking attendance by using facial recognition technology. It identifies students or employees from a live video stream or a static image and records their attendance in a CSV file with timestamps.
